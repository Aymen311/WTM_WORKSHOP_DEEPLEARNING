<img src="Python%20Basics/images/welcome_to_ML_workshop.png" alt="Cover" title="ML WORKSHOP Cover" />
This repository will guid you through the workshop material and all the tools that you need to begin learning. It consists of Programming exercises that will enhance the theoretical knowledge that you acquired before. In this workshop we will learn about what is Deep Learning and how it's a different approach from machine learning, Learn about Numpy, Pandas , Matplotlib and other ML libraries.

### Download and Install the tools needed

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment.

#### Note that you need to have python installed ( v3.8 or + ) if you don't, go and [install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) first, then we can move forward.
#### If you have an oldest version, you can update it later using `conda update python` 

#### 1. Installation

**Download** the latest version of `Anaconda` that matches your system.
